# Words of Wonders Helper
#### A simple utility for finding the right words for all levels.

### How does it work?
This utility is a simple question-based terminal application written in Rust.

### Switching the language
To switch the language you'll have to replace the `wordlist.txt` file in the root directory. For english & german there are Python scripts inside of the `scripts`-directory making the switch as simple as running such script.

>! After updating the wordlist, you'll have to recompile the program as the list is included within the final binary.
